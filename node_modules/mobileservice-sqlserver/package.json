  "readme": "# mobileservices-sqlserver\r\n\r\nThis is a slightly modified version of the [Microsoft Driver for Node.js for SQL Server][msnodesql], \r\ndesigned for usage from Azure Mobile Services. Specifically, it:\r\n\r\n- maintains backwards compatibility as the driver was first included in Mobile Services as 'sqlserver', and so there is still code in the wild doing `require('sqlserver')`.\r\n- includes prebuilt binaries for node 0.6.x, 0.8.x and 0.10.x, so no additional build steps or MSI installations are required.\r\n\r\n[msnodesql]: https://github.com/Azure/node-sqlserver",
